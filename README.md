# `Alia`

Moving from a traditional to a `remote working environment` can be frustrating, but it doesn't have to be! 

Alia's internal social media platform offers employees an opportunity to `find a balance in their life` through a sense of community and collaboration both on and off the clock. 

Find out how we are making remote work feel like being in the same room! 👊

## `What Issue Is Alia Solving?`
Alia was created to solve one of the `biggest problems` one might face as a remote worker - feeling left out. This application aims to solve this long-existing issue through `combining team management tools with social media` - leaving out the like button which avoids people to keep checking their posts.

Don't make people feel isolated. Make them feel `appreciated`! 🌻

## `Installing Alia`

### `Step 1`

Download ['alia'](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia) and ['alia-api'](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia-api) and make sure to create a .env file on the client side which includes a port where the server can run. Alia was running on port 8080 in development. Therefore, we recommend using the same.

### `Step 2`

Run `npm install` on the client and server side to download all dependencies.


### `Step 3`

Run `npm run migrate` and `npm run seed` on the server side to populate the database.


### `Step 4`

You're almost done! On the client side run `npm start` to launch the application and `npx nodemon` on the server side to start the server. Welcome to Alia!

Have fun! 🌻
